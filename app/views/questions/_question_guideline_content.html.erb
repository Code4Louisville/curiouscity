  <p><strong>What makes a good Curious City question?</strong>
  To increase the chances of WFPL picking your question for a vote, make sure it satisfies these guidelines:
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Local Relevance:</strong> Questions that in some way relate to Louisville or the region.
  Example of an irrelevant question: Why is Chicago’s Navy Pier such a popular spot for fishing?
  Example of a relevant question: Why don't passenger trains run through Louisville any longer?
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Unbiased:</strong> Curiosity requires an open mind and impartiality.
  Example of a biased question:  Why are the TARC’s bus drivers and train operators so bad at their jobs?
  Example of an unbiased question: Why do the TARC’s buses and trains sometimes arrive at the same time even though they can track each other?
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Clearly stated:</strong> Read your question to be sure it makes sense and do your best with spelling and grammar.
  Example of an unclear question: Burbs some in, and others no?
  Example of a clear question: Why are some suburbs part of Louisville's Jefferson County and others aren't?
