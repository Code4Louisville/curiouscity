<h3>Got a question about Chicago, the region or the people who live here? Anything you’ve always wondered about, found peculiar or downright confusing? Ask questions, vote, discover answers. It’s your Curious City.</h3>

<p>
Curious City is an ongoing news experiment at <a href="http://www.wbez.org">WBEZ</a> to include the public in editorial decision-making, make 
journalism more transparent, and strengthen multimedia coverage about Chicago, the surrounding region and its 
people (past or present).
</p>
<p>
All Curious City stories originate with questions submitted by the public. WBEZ producers and editors regularly 
sift through those questions and work with reporters, radio hosts, <a href="http://www.wbez.org/series/curious-city/what-qualifications-do-you-need-be-professional-zamboni-driver-106807">videographers</a>, <a href="http://www.wbez.org/series/curious-city/question-answered-do-descendants-chicago%E2%80%99s-native-american-tribes-live-city"> photographers</a>, <a href="http://www.wbez.org/blogs/louisa-chu?page=2">bloggers</a>, <a href="http://wbez-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/curiouscity/kathy/">comic</a> 
<a href="http://wbez-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/curiouscity/kathy/">artists</a> and even <a href="http://www.wbez.org/series/curious-city/hmmm-if-only-our-curiosity-had-anthem-105512">musicians</a> to find the best answers. Curious City often places questions into <a href="">voting rounds</a>, so the 
public can make the final decision about what to investigate! 
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, the curious citizens who submit questions regularly help track down answers. Some have helped 
conduct interviews, others have supplied important photos or documents and many have appeared live on <a href="http://www.wbez.org/player">WBEZ 
  91.5 FM!</a> 
</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>

<strong>● How do you collect questions?</strong>
<p>
We collect questions through this website (top of the page!), through messages left at our toll-free number (1-888-
789-7752), or when we’re pounding the pavement in the city and surrounding area. 
</p>
<strong>● Are there questions you do not accept? </strong>
<p>
All questions asked make it to the question archive unless they don’t meet the website’s guidelines for decorum, 
fairness or obvious conflicts of interest. We do not investigate questions about WBEZ or posed by staff at WBEZ or 
its parent organization, Chicago Public Media .
</p>
<strong>● How do you pick the questions for voting rounds?</strong>
<p>
WBEZ producers and editors identify questions that have potential to be answered by staff, freelancers, or 
volunteers. Often, Curious City will look for a theme (e.g., “history”) and fill the voting round with questions 
related to the theme. Editors and producers also consider regional diversity, tone, or timeliness. Sometimes 
Curious City will deliberately create voting rounds with no obvious theme, so we can gauge the public’s interest in 
novel topics. 
</p>
<strong>● What happens if my question is in a voting round?</strong>
<p>
Well first off, congratulations! We typically keep votes open for anywhere from a week to two weeks, a range that 
allows us to juggle schedules for reporters, producers and show hosts. We notify question submitters of how long 
the round will last so they can ask friends, family and social networks for their support.
</p>
<p>
If your question does win a vote you’re in for double congratulations! Curious City will discuss options of how 
you might participate in the investigation, depending on your interest and schedule, as well as the schedule 
of reporters or producers. The public at large will also be able to follow the investigation as it unfolds via our 
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/curiouscityproject">Facebook page</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/WBEZCuriousCity">Twitter feed</a> and <a href="http://curiouscity.wbez.org/">website</a>.
</p>
<strong>● What happens if my question is in a voting round and doesn’t win? Will it still get answered?</strong>
<p>
There is hope for your question! WBEZ editors and producers regularly scan the question archive. Often, they’ll 
investigate questions that never made to a voting round. Or, they’ll find that a question has already been 
answered in some way — either through a previous Curious City investigation or a WBEZ radio story, show 
segment, interview or web story. There’s another way your question may be answered: The public weighs in! 
Anyone can comment on questions. If you know the answer to someone else’s question or even have leads or 
points others should consider, don’t be shy! Let them know the information you have, and whenever possible, cite 
your sources.
</p>
<strong>● Why do you change the wording of some questions when they enter a voting round?</strong>
<p>
Curious City edits some questions for clarity and brevity. Editors and producers attempt to recast otherwise 
relevant or provocative questions that mischaracterize small details or remain too broad. The goal is to indicate 
what lines of investigation WBEZ is likely to pursue, so the public can clearly understand the choices and vote 
deliberately.

<h3>The Team</h3>

<strong>Jennifer Brandel</strong>: Founder + Senior Producer
<p>
Jennifer is air traffic controller for all things curious. She produces the series (think massive amounts of emailing, 
listening, diagram-making, meetings) and occasionally sees daylight while reporting for it, too. Prior to Curious 
City, Jennifer reported for WBEZ’s newsdesk and for national radio shows including All Things Considered, Day 
to Day, Weekend America, Latino USA, and Interfaith Voices and has collected a few Associated Press awards for 
that work. She’s served as an assistant producer for Wait! Wait! Don’t Tell Me!, a blogger for Transom.org, and 
the talent for pieces aired on WireTap, Love and Radio, and How To Do Everything. Jennifer has managed radio 
conferences and produced broadcasts for The Third Coast International Audio Festival. Her photos have appeared 
in The New York Times online and Vice Magazine, and she dabbles in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzNN3Zukl8">music video-making</a>, <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/dog-gif">petting dogs</a> and 
pitching for the WBEZ 16 inch softball team.
</p>
<strong>Shawn Allee</strong>: Editor
<p>
Shawn edits whatever the minds of Curious City’s producers, reporters and other contributors might dream 
up. His favorite thing to say is: “Follow your heart, then get an edit.” His own radio work landed him on NPR’s 
On The Media, All Things Considered, This American Life, Marketplace and other public radio outlets. His own 
investigations earned him top honors from the Illinois Associated Press, the Society of Environmental Journalists, 
the Illinois News Broadcasters Association, and the Radio Television Digital News Association. He really digs taking 
photographs, especially of his cats, his prized LEGO robots, his Chicago neighborhood, and his native Iowa.
</p>
<strong>Logan Jaffe</strong>: Multimedia producer
<p>
Logan shoots and produces photo, video, interactive and web content for Curious City. Somewhat of a multimedia 
ninja, she’s previously worked as a photojournalist, reporter and web/graphic designer, but couldn’t pick just one. 
Her first independent documentary, <a href="https://vimeo.com/76725053">The Road to Somewhere Else</a> (Highway 127 & The World’s Longest Yard Sale) 
appeared in Digital Americana’s Fall 2013 issue. She’s been a finalist in KCRW’s <a href="https://soundcloud.com/shrimpeyes/zamboni-rosrs-a-sign-of-the">24-hour radio race</a> and in the Third 
Coast International Audio Festival’s <a href="https://soundcloud.com/shrimpeyes/sweet-small-victory">ShortDocs challenge</a>. A Miami native, Jaffe graduated from the University of 
Florida’s with a degree in photojournalism and spends her free time hunting for home movies, home-recorded 
tape cassettes and other obsolete, <a href="https://vimeo.com/25010270">lost media to reassemble</a>.
